# Hi, I'm Anderson ðŸ‘‹

### Senior Software Engineer | JavaScript-Focused Full-Stack Developer ðŸš€

I&apos;m a senior software engineer specializing in full-stack
JavaScript and TypeScript development, with a deep passion for
creating scalable and efficient web applications. My expertise spans
the entire JavaScript ecosystem, particularly with frameworks like
Node.js, React, and Next.js, where I&apos;ve built numerous
production-grade applications that prioritize performance and user
experience.

Over the past 9+ years, I&apos;ve honed my skills in building robust
back-end systems with Node.js, crafting intuitive and responsive
front-end interfaces using React, and delivering optimized,
server-side rendered applications with Next.js. My development
philosophy revolves around writing clean, modular, and reusable code
that adheres to functional programming principles. This allows me to
maintain flexibility and scalability even in complex projects.

I also have a strong understanding of the underlying technologies that
power modern web development, including API design, microservices
architecture, and CI/CD pipelines. Whether it&apos;s creating APIs,
managing databases, or implementing custom UI components, I focus on
delivering high-quality, maintainable solutions that meet both
technical and business requirements.
