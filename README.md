# Hi, I'm Anderson 👋

### Senior Backend Engineer · Distributed Systems · Functional & Polyglot Developer 🚀

Senior Software Engineer specialized in backend systems, APIs, and distributed architectures. I design and build scalable, resilient, and high-performance services, applying functional programming principles within pragmatic, production-ready systems.

While JavaScript and TypeScript are my primary tools, I work across multiple backend languages and paradigms, choosing the right level of abstraction, safety, and performance for each problem.
